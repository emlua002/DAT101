      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented development is important in programming because it organizes code into objects, which can represent real-world entities. It also helps break large programs into smaller, self-contained pieces (classes and objects). This makes code easier to manage, understand, and reuse.</p>

      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>The "AccountType" object is used to define and categorize different types of bank accounts. By using a static object, we can easily reference and manage these account types throughout our code. This approach creates consistency, and reduces errors, as we can use the predefined values instead of hardcoding strings in multiple places.</p>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>We use encapsulation in classes to hide internal details of how something works, and only exposing whats necessary. We do this to protect data, get a cleaner interface (makes it less confusing for the user), and creates flexibility for future changes. In JavaScript, we can create "private" members using the # syntax, and "public" members without it.</p>
      
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript</li>
      <p>when we use the keyword "new" in javascript, i tell my program to "create a new object based on this function or class".</p>
